Answer 1: There are three types of iteration constructs: 
for loops, while loops, and do-while loops. Although it is possible to achieve 
the same behavior using any of these constructs, I prefer using the for loop when working 
with arrays. The for loop provides a concise and structured way to iterate over the 
elements of an array. By defining the loop initialization, condition, and 
increment/decrement in a single line, the code becomes more readable and the loop control 
variables are contained within the loop's scope. This makes the for loop the more preferred
option when working with arrays.

Answer 2: To test and debug my program, I followed a systematic approach. For syntactic errors, 
I relied on the compiler to help me identify and report any issues. The compiler provided error 
messages that pointed out the specific lines causing problems. By carefully reviewing these 
error messages, I was able to locate and fix syntax errors such as missing semicolons, mismatched 
parentheses, or incorrect variable types.
For semantic errors, I employed a combination of techniques. Firstly, I used print statements
strategically placed throughout the code to print intermediate values and track the flow of the 
program. By observing the output of these print statements, I could identify any inconsistencies
or unexpected behaviors in the program's logic. This allowed me to narrow down the location 
of the issue.
Additionally, I utilized a debugger to step through the code line by line. Using the debugger,
I could inspect the values of variables at different points in the program and analyze the 
execution flow. By closely examining the variable values and comparing them to my expectations,
I could pinpoint semantic errors and correct them accordingly.

Answer 3: To successfully identify and fix the error, I will follow these steps:

A. I will open the output.txt file and locate line number 6 as indicated in the error message.
B. I will compare the character at column 33 in my output with the expected character, which is 
ASCII code 48 (the character '0').
C. If my output contains a different character (ASCII code not equal to 48), it means there is an 
error in printing the expected value.
D. I will review the corresponding part of my code responsible for printing the monthly NET income.
E. I will ensure that the correct input is being given (here, 0) and then, read and stored in the 
income variable before it is printed.
F. I will make any necessary corrections to ensure that the output matches the expected output,
i.e., "Enter your monthly NET income: $0".

By following these steps, I will be able to identify and rectify the error in the output, allowing me
to successfully submit my work.
